# NLP Workshop – Probabilistic and Vector Space Models

## Overview

This repository contains two workshop notebooks designed to guide you through building a complete NLP pipeline and implementing foundational probabilistic language models. The focus is on **n-gram language modeling** (unigram and bigram models) and **text generation using probability distributions**. The primary dataset consists of simulated FAQs generated with ChatGPT, covering a variety of topics.


Each notebook features:
- Step-by-step code for document collection, tokenization, normalization, and vectorization
- Implementation of n-gram models and text generation
- Clear markdown explanations and hands-on exercises
- Collaborative coding and peer feedback best practices
